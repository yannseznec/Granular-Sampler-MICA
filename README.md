# Granular-Sampler-MICA
Granular Sampler for teaching reference


This is the Pure Data code that I used in this tutorial video: https://youtu.be/tpL7l4oX42Q

It's a granular sound patch for loading or sampling audio and playing around. Download these patches and watch the video to learn about granular synthesis! It's fun, I promise.
